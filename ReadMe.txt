This package contains the following:

-Red's Map Loader
-An .xml file full of codes, all organized into sections.
-A player.pack that gives Octolings a lighter tint to their hair. (Use with OctoHax for obvious results.)
-Another .txt file that is a guide on how to swap your Amiibo Weapon.
-Two Versions of the Weapon-Texture Hacking I've done:
Sheldon's Picks: TextureHax
and
All weapons texture hacked.
-Gear TextureHax (just the Basic Tee and Studio Headphones.. :P)
-Files I have on my SD for Wii U Homebrew. (Nothing special, just in case~)
-Credits.txt, listing all of the people who deserve to be mentioned.
