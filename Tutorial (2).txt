Here's how to do it yourself:

*Make sure you have the following:
Geckiine (http://oatmealdome.me/geckiine/)
SD Card
GeckoDNet (https://github.com/Chadderz121/tcp-gecko-dotnet)
Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.4.2.html)
A Static.pack (Links above for my premade-ones, if you do not have one.)
SARCTools (https://github.com/NWPlayer123/WiiUTools/tree/master/SARCTools)


1. If your Static.pack is already extracted, move onto step 2. 
If it isn't, place SARCExtract and SARCpack in the same folder as your Static.Pack. Then, open a command prompt and type "SARCExtract.py Static.pack".
Optionally, you could drag your Static.pack onto the .py file. 
2. Now you should have a folder called "Static". Find the folder named "Parameter" inside of it. (Static\Parameter)
3. Depending on the Weapon you'd like to change, locate one of the following .params files:
If you're swapping the Hero Roller, find "RollerMission.params" (Inkling Boy Amiibo) and open it with NotePad++. (Right click it.)
If you're swapping the Hero Charger, find "ChargeShotMission.params" (Inkling Girl Amiibo) and open it with NotePad++. (Right click it.)
If you're swapping the HeroShot, find "NormalShotMsn0Lv0.params" (Squid Amiibo) and open it with NotePad++. (Right click it.)
4. Then, find the weapon you'd like to swap it with.

Octobrush // RollerBrushNormal
Splat Charger // ChargeShotNormal
Splatterscope // ChargeShotNormalScope

E-Liter 3K - ChargeShotLong
E-Liter 3K Scope // ChargeShotLongScope
Bamboozler 14 MKs // ChargeShotLight
=Slosher // BigBallStrong
=Tri-Slosher // BigBallDiffusion
=Sloshing Machine // BigBall??? (Launcher, IIRC)
=Heavy Splatling // GatlingStandard
=Mini Splatling // GatlingQuick
=Hydra Splatling // GatlingHyper
Then, open that file in NotePad++.
*Blasters may not work, due to their being a separate file for their explosion. Try a different weapon instead.
=Sloshers and Gatlings may not work, due to (afaik, from my testing) both HERO and NORMAL weapon counterparts have to be present.
4b. It should look like this:
http://prntscr.com/fswqis
(Your parameter names will most likely be different than mine. As long as you have one of the parameter names for the Hero Weapons, and one for a normal weapon, you will be fine.)
5. Use Ctrl + A on the parameter you want to use (let's say, ChargeShotLong.params, in this instance) and then press Ctrl + C to copy all of it.
5b. Go to the other parameter file (let's say, ChargeShotMission,params, for instance) and press Ctrl + A, then Ctrl + V. 
5c. Make sure the numbers and such on both files are the same, they should look identical if you did it correctly.
6. Save the file you used Ctrl + V on. 
7. After closing NotePad++, and double checking to make sure the changes were saved to one of the Hero weapons, run a command prompt in the folder and type "SARCPack.py Static"
7b. You should get a file named "Static.sarc" after it is done. 
--Before continuing, make sure you know how to use a Caffine Server, and already have a Geckiine.elf (iirc, that's what it's called) file in your SD Card where it should go. I WILL NOT assist with help regarding either of the two.--
8. Start your Wii U, go to Loadiine.ovh, run the HBL, then launch Geckiine. Make sure your Caffine Server is running, and make sure it connects.
8b. Launch Splatoon.
9. If your Caffine Server has crashed, displaying; "Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.", it means it crashed. This is a user error. Try redoing the process, or ONLY use the Static.Pack while launching Caffine. The other files may be the cause of the crash.
10. Connect GeckoDNet, and go into the Shooting Range.
10b. Go to the Memory Viewer tab and go to the following address: 106E46E8
10c. Copy the value that's displayed there, then make the value an address. (For example, if the value is 12345678, use it as an address.)
10d. Locate a value called "3F800000". Make sure your viewing mode is Hexadecimal. Next to the 3F800000 value, is a number. Turn on Auto Update and select the weapon whose params you edited earlier. The value should change if it's the correct address.
You may have to scroll down a bit to find it. 
10e. Take mental note of the value you see next to the 3F800000. Write it down or something.
11. Exit, and go to the amiibo box, then tap your amiibo and go into a level.
11b. Go back to the "106E46E8" address in Memory Viewer. Take the value you see there and use it as an address. 
11c. Locate the "3F800000" value from earlier. Next to it, you should see one of the following values:
5B = Hero Shot
5F = Hero Roller
60 = Hero Charger
Poke the value with the value from step 10e. It should change from 5B/5F/60 to the new value.
DO NOT PRESS ZR. YOU WILL CRASH AND WILL HAVE TO RESTART YOUR GAME.
12. Kill your player, or restart the challenge.
12b. The weapon model should change into the correct weapon. If not, try poking again.
13. Poke the value from earlier back (5B/5F/60). Doing so makes the game use the parameter file you modified earlier, giving the appearance of your changed weapon.
Your weapon should now have the look and fire like the weapon you changed it to be.
Fairly elaborate swap for ya. <3

(Note: Everytime you go into a different Amiibo Level for the same Amiibo, you have to redo steps 11b. and onward.)
